## Azure Kinect DK on Jetson Xavier


When you use Jetpack 5.x on Xavier NX, it uses Ubuntu 20.04. 

And when I tried with Jetpack 4.6, which uses Ubuntu 18.04, the error related with OpenGL version occured with using Depth Engine.


Furthermore, Microsoft usually gives SDK only for AMD64 architecture, results that Body Tracking SDK is not supported even in 2023
